## General Information
- Boombikes wants to get a deeper understanding of bike rentals under different circumstances to maximize the bike rentals.

- The solution is to develop a model that determines the importance of each factor(Variable) on the overall bike rental count
- Bike sharing data set that contains the count of number of rides happend with all other promient factors along with the years.
